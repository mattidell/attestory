# Foreman Handoff Note

A lightweight, living continuity note — **not a protocol and not a gate.** It
describes now. Durable history lives in milestone retrospectives, review
records, ADRs, and Git; this file links there rather than retelling it.

## Re-entry

Render the advisory capsule from an explicit committed ref:

```sh
.venv/bin/python3 tools/foreman_context.py --ref HEAD --format markdown
```

Reconcile its source commit and worktree report with Git, then read the
action-specific sources it names. If it refuses, inspect those committed sources
directly and resolve the disagreement before acting. The capsule does not
authorize a foreman dispatch, change the data boundary, or replace accepted
authority.

## Current state (2026-07-24)

- **Live-Run System Definition and Trust Domains:** complete; ADR-0044 accepted
  as a positioning contract; closure PR #61 **merged**. It selects and schedules
  no enforcement mechanism, makes no L4 claim.
- **Presentation Exploratory Milestone:** complete 2026-07-24. An **exploratory
  milestone (no ADR, no matrix cell raised)** — studied developing/evaluating UI
  under agent-authored, agent-reviewed, owner-light constraints, using a synthetic
  citation-walk surface. Five 2-builder/2-reviewer cycles. Finding: developable
  via a demonstrated loop; ~65–80% of UI quality is agent-mechanizable. Main
  artifact = seven evaluation-analysis documents at
  `docs/prototypes/human-presentation-citation-walk/analysis/` (cycle log +
  process in the sibling `plan.md`; reference prototypes/fixtures/harness-seed
  under `reference/`; retrospective pointer
  `docs/milestone-retrospectives/2026-07-24-presentation-exploratory-milestone.md`).
  Raising the Presentation matrix aspect for real remains a well-formed but
  **unselected** ADR-0013 decision prototype.
- **Next:** the next milestone **squarely targets process economy** (owner
  direction 2026-07-24), grounded on `.../analysis/04-economy.md`. No milestone is
  active yet.
- **Data boundary:** all committed evidence remains synthetic. Do not access or
  record a real workspace, credential, remote, output, or location. The
  owner-held live-run helpers remain untracked.
